I guess I create alot of gaming related sites its what I'm used to.
I wanted this one to be nicer to look at which is why I implemented the video playing stock footage in the background I think it helps the site look more "official"
I also wanted to try making the cards look nicer so I had them float when hovered over.
If possible I'd like to try using more animations next time as for now the fade in of the main text in the center is what fades in
